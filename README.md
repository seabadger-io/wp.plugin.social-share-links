# wp.plugin.social-share-links
Add static social share links to posts in SeaBadgerMD theme

## About
This simple plugin generates social media share links on single posts and pages. These are simple buttons, e.g. no javascript is included. While it doesn't look as nice as the active versions, it doesn't require loading all the JS of the social media sites and doesn't add unnecessary tracking of the same.

It's designed to work with the [SeaBadgerMD](https://seabadger.io/seabadgermd-wordpress-theme/) WordPress theme. It may work on other themes, but you will have to load FontAwesome and style certain classes to make it look nice.

It adds share links to Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus, LinkedIn and Reddit

## Configuration
Sorry, this plugin is not configurable at the moment. You can hide the share links per page/post from the post editor.
